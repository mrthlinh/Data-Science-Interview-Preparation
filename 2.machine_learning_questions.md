## Machine Learning Summary

For each algorithm
- Definition
- Parameter
- Assumption

### Part 1: Traditional Machine Learning
1. Linear regression

__Definition:__ linear relation between Y and X

- Correlation: strength of relation between two variables
- R-square: measures the proportion of variability in Y that can be explained using X. __in other words, how much variance of output / observed value / Y is because of inputs / X__
- Adjusted R-squared: a new version R-squared in multiple regression (add penalty if adding more inputs does not help)
- R-square does not tell you whether the model is good or not, it is just tell you relationship between movements of 2 variables.
- Collinearity: two or more X are closed related to one another, adding both of them does not lead to improvement -> scatter plot to check it
- In multiple variable, we need to decide which variables are important. We can do this by examine p-value associate with each X's t-statistic. P-low -> we can accept alternative hypothesis, the variable is important
- K-NN regressor: get average of K points, if choose K wisely, can approximate linear
