## List of question

1.  Tell me about your experience and background
I’m studying Master of Computer Science at University of Texas at Dallas. During my time there, my concentration is Data Scientist and Machine Learning.
Therefore, I took courses such as Machine Learning, Big Data, Statistical Method for Data Science, I even took extra class in Statistics Department to enhance my knowledge in this field.
I also worked on researches of software engineering. My main task is to implement some Machine Learning algorithm to help software engineers have easier time when they do their jobs.
In my free time, I took part in Kaggle Competition and personal projects, I put all codes with well-written document in my Github so every could see it.
In my internship, I was assigned to implement a production level machine learning system to estimate user story point in Agile.
Thanks for hands-on experience and theory I obtained from my time at university, I was not only successfully complete the task but also delivered a report which include my findings and methodology.
In additional, I also completed 6-month Data Science Boot Camp that covers many aspect of data science for example data mining / visualization, manipulating and analyzing data, hypothesis testing, machine learning, tune model and interpret results.
These experience and background make me think I could be a good fit for this position.
2. Why do you want to be a data scientist/analyst
In high school, my favorite class is geography and mathematics, especially geography. There is one kind of assignment in geography class that I always feel interesting is when the teacher gave me a bundle of charts – bar chart or pie chart and statement (compare growth rate of population between two nations) he asked me to make an analysis to prove that statement is right or wrong, or maybe he may asked me to make a general analysis from those charts. My analysis was quite simple but it brought me fundamental knowledge of how to do data visualization and make analysis.
When I want to university, I was interested in computer programming and statistics and I always tried my best in those classes.
Then I found out Data Science is a combination of my favorite subjects, statistics, computer programming and data visualization and analysis.

3. Why do you want to work at this company?
I like to learn something new everyday and in Amazon I feel there is indefinite resources for me to learn. Amazon starts from an online shop and now look at what you have, not just online shop any more, now you have AWS, Fire Tablet, Fire Tv, Alexa and maybe much more. The continuous growth of Amazon inspire me to be a better person everyday by learning. And that is the main reason why I choose Amazon.

4. Tell me about a time you had to handle a conflict with your colleagues.
Conflict: My boss assign a task for me, he propose solution A and B (which he had experience) for me but I think they are not sufficient enough for this problem, I did a few research and find a paper with workable solution. However he denied it because he prefer experience to theory, even he never read it he told me the paper is full of theory and won’t work. I used to work in academia, also co-author of accepted two papers of top-tier conference. I know that every breakthrough in industry in based on some outstanding papers. Next day, I came to him and said if he would give me a chance to give a presentation of the paper in front of every people, he accepted. It took me 4 days to prepare for the presentation, I added many photos or illustrations and also use simple words just to make sure everyone could understand it. Luckily, everyone likes my presentation and the idea behind the paper. Then I and my team successfully implemented the paper and put it in our products which led to significant increase in productivity by 8%..
5. Tell me the achievement you feel most proud of
When I was senior student, I attended a design competition of Texas Instrument. I formed a team with 2 of my friends and we designed a drone, back to that day, drone was not that popular and there were no one ever building drone on TI hardware. So there were not many resources or tutorial available. It took us 3 months to build a drone from scratch. In last 2 weeks, we even have to sleep in the lab.  The nightmare was in last 2 days, there was some components in our drone broken and there were not enough time for us to find replacement. We are very frustrated and we even thought about giving up. As a leader, I tried to encourage my teammates and told them that no matter what happened our team has to continue and couldn’t give up hope. So we tried our best to fix it but it still not working properly.
You know what, we came to the competition with not so much expectation but finally, to all of the sudden, we won the 3rd prize. I feel really proud of myself and my team because we tried our best and never gave up.

6. What is your biggest weakness?
I’m not very good at gauging how long a task will take me to finish. I quite often underestimate the time it will take to do smaller jobs. The result is that I don’t delegate enough time to larger, more important projects. I have to rush to get things done. Sometimes I miss deadlines. To address the issue, I list out tasks and their priority in the beginning of a week, then I put them in my calendar, I also put them in a to-do list in my phone so I can check my plan everywhere.

7. What is your strength?

8. Tell me the time when you work in a team?

9. What did you do if your project not go well?

10. Tell me projects you feel most proud of.
