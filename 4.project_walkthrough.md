# Project Walkthrough

## Procedure
1. Explain Problems: what is input, output / goal, challenge
2. Explain your methodology (short)? What model you choose and reason (pros and cons)?
3. What is the most interesting insight you find out?
4. The results? Does it make sense?


## FIFA World Cup 2018

__Goal:__ Predict winners and goal difference in FIFA World Cup 2018

__Challenge__: I encountered many challenges

  - I don't have a complete dataset for my task
  -

## Spotify Playlist Recommendation

__Goal:__ Predict which songs will be added to current Playlist

__Challenge:__ Processing Power and memory because the data are really sparse.

__Evaluation:__
  - R (retrieved) - precision: Number of retrieved relevant tracks / Number of actual relevant track.
  - Normalized Discounted cumulative gain (NDCG): Rank quality of recommended tracks, higher means relevant track are placed at higher position
  - Song Clicks: How many time user has to click "Other songs" to find the first relevant songs.

__Methodology:__ Common method to build a Recommendation System:
  - Content-based filtering (the simplest way): require experts or customer to manually investigate products and put them label for various category.
    - Advantage : Straight-forward, easy solution
    - Disadvantage: Manual work is huge

  - K Nearest Neighbor: Find the most similar user and add all items in their basket to your basket
    - Advantage:
    - Disadvantage: The behavior of the current user is heavily affected by the most relevant user. For example: two sisters usually go shopping with other so probably their similarity are the closest however their taste are different.  

  - Collaborative filtering: item and user based CF, measure the similarity between each item or user to make inference.
    - Advantage: Don't need content of item or user, just look at their history, eliminate the such bias because it is weighted sum with normalization
    - Disadvantage:
      - We need maintain a big table of similarity matrix between each item or user.
      - Cold start: cannot five recommendation for new user
      - Adding new item / users to the system: no interactions of new item/user make it hard to make recommendation.
      These problems can be fixed by asking users for other type of data of the time they sign-up.

  - Model based:
    - Matrix factorization: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Neural Net Embedding vector. I prefer embedding vector because it is batch training so we won't need to load all data into memory.
    - Decomposed vectors can be use as feature vectors for another Neural network.
